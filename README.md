[See our list of projects](projects/projects.md)

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. Google may provide students with stipends at Google's sole discretion. In general the stipends are adjusted to cost of living. More info can be found on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)

## If you want to work on a moja global project through GSoC...
Students can indicate their interest in working with moja global by just sending an email to info@moja.global or going through the [Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) Open Source Center (OSC) ideas page](https://hub.osc.dial.community/t/google-summer-of-code-2020-open-source-center/1025).

Students still have to write up a project proposal for the summer and submit it to Google. If accepted, students will spend a month getting to know moja global prior to coding into their preferred project. Students then have three months to code, meeting the deadlines agreed upon with their mentors.

## moja global submitted its GSoC ideas through DIAL
The DIAL Open Source Center is moja global's ‚Äúumbrella organization‚Äù to GSoC. This will help raise awareness about moja global's proposed projects among student applicants. The [moja global projects can be found on the DIAL website](https://hub.osc.dial.community/t/gsoc-2020-ideas-moja-global/1024).

The DIAL Open Source Center (OSC) is a collective group of people and open source projects working together to build co-investment in shared resources that benefit each other.
